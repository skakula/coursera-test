<p>
Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia on January 15, 2001. 
Sanger coined its name, a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia. 
Initially only in English, Wikipedia quickly became multilingual as it developed 
similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing practices. 
The English Wikipedia is now one of 291 Wikipedia editions and is the largest with 5,116,056 articles 
(having reached 5,000,000 articles in November 2015).

<p>
Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,
 and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"
 was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.

<p>
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle
regarding the security of its content. It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. 
Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.
