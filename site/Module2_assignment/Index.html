Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia on January 15, 2001. 
Sanger coined its name, a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia. 
Initially only in English, Wikipedia quickly became multilingual as it developed 
similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing practices. 
The English Wikipedia is now one of 291 Wikipedia editions and is the largest with 5,116,056 articles.
